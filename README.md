# BiasVisualization

This project aims to uncover bias categories across different online communities. Here, racial and gender biases were investigated using datasets from Google News, the far-right online plattform GAB, and reddit's r/all.
Gensim's word2vec word embedding was used for calculating the word vectors.
### Datasets

### Results
Full results are summarised in the paper `./CSE517_Final_Project_Paper`.
Some images that explore bias differences across our online communities can be found under `./Explorative Bias Insights`. Note that the author of the visualization tool mentioned in the paper has decided to not make her work open source.

### Replication
The scripts in `./Analysis` can be used for replication of the word embedding part of this work.
